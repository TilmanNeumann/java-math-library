 * (INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne)
 *
 * Pollards Rho method. Pollard's rho method is a randomized factoring algorithm
 * that can factor 128 bit numbers in a reasonable amount of time, especially if
 * the numbers have some small factors. It is based on the following fact: if d is
 * the smallest nontrivial factor of N and x - y is a nontrivial multiple of d then
 * gcd(x-y, N) = d. A naive method would be to generate a bunch of random values
 * x[1], x[2], ..., x[m] and compute gcd(x[i]-x[j], N) for all pairs i and j.
 * Pollard's rho method is an ingenious method way to find x and y without doing
 * all of the pairwise computations. It works as follows: choose a and b at random
 * between 1 and N-1, and initialize x = y = a. Repeatedly update x = f(x), y = f(f(y)),
 * where f(x) = x^2 + b as long as gcd(x-y, N) = 1. The gcd is a factor of N, but if you
 * get unlucky, it could be equal to N. By randomly choosing a and b each time, we
 * ensure that we never get too unlucky.
