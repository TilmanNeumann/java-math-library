 * An <em>elementary</em> smooth or partially smooth congruence A^2 == Q (mod N).
 * Elementary means that only one (A,Q) pair is involved.

 * Factoring large numbers will produce millions of partials, and their memory demands dominate the memory consumption
 * of the whole quadratic sieve algorithm. To store them as efficiently as possible, large factors are added by subclasses.
 * 
 * The estimated memory requirement of the fields in this class is 240 byte; adding 16 bytes for its own object header gives around 256 byte.
