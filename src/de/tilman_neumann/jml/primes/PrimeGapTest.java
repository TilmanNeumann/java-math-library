/**
 * Find primes with relatively large prime gaps, say ratios p(i)/p(i-1) > p(k)/p(k-1) for all k > i.
 * 
 * Bertrand’s postulate states that there is a prime in any interval [n, 2n].
 * Legendre's conjecture says that there is at least one prime in any interval (n^2, (n+1)^2).
 * But for not too small i, the true maximum ratio p(i)/p(i-1) is much smaller than that.
 * 
 * The main purpose of this class is to find the following rational sequence:
 * Numerators are A277718 = "Bounding prime for the first k-Ramanujan prime."
 * Denominators are A209407 = "Primes p(i) such that p(i+1)/p(i) > p(k+1)/p(k) for all k>i"
 * 
 * Bounds are taken from Christian Axler, Thomas Leßmann: "An explicit upper bound for the first k-Ramanujan prime" 2018,
 * https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.05485.pdf, and the proof procedure has been derived from comments by Charles Greathouse IV. in A209407.
 * 
 * A few results:
 * 1. Testing all primes below 1e11 allows us to prove the first 87 sequence elements.
 * 2. Trudgian's bound is not satisfied at a(75) ?
 * 3. Trudgian's bound seems to be the one of most practical relevance; the transition point between Trudgian's bound
 *    and Axler/Leßmann's bound is at approximately e^131.1687 = 9.24363...*10^56.
