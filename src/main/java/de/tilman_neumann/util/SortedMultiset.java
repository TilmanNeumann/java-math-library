/**
 * A multiset with a sort relation between elements.<br>
 * 
 * The sorting of elements has the following consequences:
 * - elements must be Comparable
 * - SortedMaps are a bit slower than HashMaps
 * - output of sorted multisets looks nicer than that of unsorted multisets
 * 
 * Since elements are sorted, we can easily define a sorting on SortedMultisets, too:
 * A sorted multiset is bigger than another one if it's biggest element is bigger
 * than the largest element of the other multiset; or the 2.nd-biggest if
 * the biggest elements are equal; or the 3.rd biggest, and so on.
