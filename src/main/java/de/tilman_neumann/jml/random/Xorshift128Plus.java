	 * Having lots of zero bytes will lead terrible initial output until the generator mixes it all up. Having all zero bytes will completely break the generator.
	 * If you’re going to seed from, say, the unix epoch, then XOR it with 16 static random bytes.
	 * 
	 * And https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift#Initialization: In the xoshiro paper, it is recommended to initialize the state of the generators using a generator
	 * which is radically different from the initialized generators, as well as one which will never give the "all-zero" state; for shift-register generators,
	 * this state is impossible to escape from. The authors specifically recommend using the SplitMix64 generator, from a 64-bit seed.
