/**
 * A cycle finding algorithm implementation following [LLDMW02], finding smooth congruences from partial relations.
 * This algorithm has been tested to work fine for partials with <= 3 large primes, and probably does so for any number of large primes.
 * 
 * As reported in the paper, the algorithm does not find cycles that do not include at least one 1LP-partial; but such cycles occur very rarely and so that's no problem at all.
 *
